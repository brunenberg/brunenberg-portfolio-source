Hello! I'm **Wouter Brunenberg**, a software engineer with a passion for building scalable applications and exploring new technologies. Here's a little more about my professional journey and interests.

## Background üîé

I'm a software engineering student at Avans Hogeschool, diving into the world of full-stack development. I've discovered a genuine interest in the logic and structure that comes with the realm of back-end work.

While I'm still relatively early in my programming journey, I feel confident that I've already gained a significant amount of knowledge. There's always more to learn, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities to expand my understanding.

I believe in the power of practical experience and am eager to apply my growing skill set in real-world situations. My goal is to keep learning and growing as a developer, aiming to become highly skilled in back-end technologies.

## Hobbies and Interests üé®

When I'm not coding, I enjoy:

- **Movies and Series:** Some of my personal favourite movies are `Pulp Fuction`, `Falling Down` and `The Truman Show`. Some of my favourite series are `Breaking Bad`, `Bojack Horseman` and `The Queen's Gambit`.
- **Reading:** I'm drawn to non-fiction and realistic fiction that offers valuable life lessons. My reading list often includes stories that portray authentic experiences and moral insights.
- **Gaming:** I mostly enjoy playing strategy board games such as `Chess` and `Settlers of Catan`, as well as videogames such as `Trackmania`, `Minecraft`, `Valorant` and a lot of story games in the `Walking Simulator` category.
- **Piano:** I took piano lessons for four years before stopping because I couldn't find the time to continue. However, I still play on occasion. Here is a sample:
