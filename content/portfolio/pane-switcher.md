## Overview 🗺️
'Pane Switcher' is an application I crafted for a programming test at school. The challenge was to replicate a given example app within 90 minutes. This app featured a button that, when pressed, would modify the appearance of various panels. Although I completed the task within the exam period, I chose to refine my work at home for better results.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Java**: The core language for crafting the application's logic.
- **JavaFX**: The toolkit I used for creating the user interface.
- **Eclipse**: The IDE where I wrote and debugged my code.

## Challenges and Solutions 🧗🏻
The primary hurdle was incorporating a `StackPane`, which was new to me. In the exam, I managed with an alternative approach, but later, at home, I realized it was a lot easier than I thought it was.

## Conclusion 🏁
This project taught me a valuable lesson: attempting unfamiliar tasks can be rewarding. Had I approached the `StackPane` during the exam, I'm confident I would have gotten all the point for this exam.
