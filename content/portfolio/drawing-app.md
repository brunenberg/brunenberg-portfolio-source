## Overview 🗺️
When school ended for the year and I had some spare time, I chose to start building a drawing/editing app using JavaFX. I had just learned about this technology and was curious to see how far I could get with this somewhat outdated technology. After setting up the basic features and tools like the pencil, brush, paint bucket, and eraser, I stopped working on the project. I decided it would be better to start exploring other technologies.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Java
- JavaFX
- Eclipse

## Challenges and Solutions 🧗🏻
While working on this ongoing project, I didn't face any big problems. The part where I had to create icons for the tools was a little tough because I used only JavaFX for it. The most challenging part was adding the anti-aliasing feature to the brush tool. I used a formula that I knew well (the Pythagorean theorem), but I encountered some issues related to how transparent the pixels were when I was coding it. After some troubleshooting, I was able to find the solutions.

## Conclusion 🏁
I really enjoyed working on this project and gained valuable insights about algorithms. I hope to complete this project someday when I have the time, because a drawing/editing application has a lot of room for expansion and can teach me a lot about user interface design and (image editing) algorithms.
