## Overview 🗺️
'Project Sagrada' was a school project that marked my first significant collaboration, where I worked with a team of five to eight people (it increased because of issues in one of the other groups). This project introduced me to Git and GitHub. Our objective was to develop an online version of the board game "Sagrada" using JavaFX. We followed a detailed list of requirements to ensure the game was up to the standard.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

## Challenges and Solutions 🧗🏻
In the beginning, I was cautious about using Git, concerned about making mistakes that could affect the project. But with time, guidance from my teammates, and practice, I became proficient in using Git. My skills and confidence in version control have greatly improved since then.

This is not the final product, but I was not able to find any more recent images. Setting up a new database and seeding it will take a while, so I might do it later.

## Conclusion 🏁
I’m pleased with the outcome of this project. Considering it was our first-year school project and involved teamwork, the code and solution are remarkably well-organized. Our dedication and effort has definitely paid off.
