## Overview üó∫Ô∏è
'Temple of Doom' is a console application developed using the .NET MVC framework. The goal of this assignment was to practice a lot of different design patterns. The front consisted of a console with different characters and colours, depending on the type of object and if it had a colour property assigned to it (in the case of a key or coloured door for example).

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

  - Decorator
  - Adapter

## Challenges and Solutions üßóüèª
One of the biggest challenges was researching all the different kind of design patterns and assessing for which purpose each pattern had to be used, without knowing a lot about them. However, the biggest challenge in my opinion, was understanding how the connections between the different rooms worked. I found it really hard to wrap my head around the idea of having connections that could also be doors (with decorators) and those had a nullable value for each direction, which corresponded with the 'id' of a room. When I finally fully understood it, the implementation was not that much of an issue, but understanding it initially was quite a challenge.

## Conclusion üèÅ
I initially was pretty intimidated by the concept of design patterns, but they turned out to be very useful and not very hard to understand and implement. I also learned about the importance of understanding concepts of 'features' thoroughly, before starting to write the code for them.
