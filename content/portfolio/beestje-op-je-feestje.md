## Overview üó∫Ô∏è
'Beestje Op Je Feestje' is an app we created in pairs using ASP.NET for a school project. The project mainly focused on validation rules, user authorization and authentication, unit testing, and hosting. An admin user can create animals with specific characteristics. These animals can then be rented by customers for a day, usually for parties. There are rules for choosing animals (for instance, some animals can't be rented with certain others, based on their name or type). There are also discount rules (like a 2% discount for every consecutive letter in the alphabet found in the combined names of all the rented animals). Following that, we had to write unit tests until at least 40% code coverage. The last step was to host the web application with Azure, along with a database.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- C#
- ASP.NET
- Unit Testing
- Azure Hosting

## Challenges and Solutions üßóüèª
The coding part of the application went pretty smoothly. The real issues started when we tried to host the web application on Azure. When we attempted to deploy the application using Visual Studio 2022, my project partner and I kept encountering the same error that we couldn't find a solution for anywhere. Once we resolved that error, each step forward led to a new error. After a long and frustrating period of dealing with errors, it finally worked.

## Conclusion üèÅ
I mostly learned how to set up rules in a straightforward way. I also learned about various hosting errors and how to resolve them. This experience did discourage me a bit from learning more about hosting, but it also taught me a lot about it.
