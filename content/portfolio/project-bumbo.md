## Overview üó∫Ô∏è
'Project Bumbo' was a group project I participated in during my school days, where our team of five was tasked with solving a pressing issue for 'Bumbo', a fictional supermarket chain. The challenge at hand was the time-consuming and inefficient scheduling process that the store manager faced every week. This often resulted in employees working overtime and shifts where the store was either understaffed or overstaffed.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- C#
- ASP.NET
- Entity Framework Core
- Azure Hosting

## Challenges and Solutions üßóüèª
Transitioning into the world of software frameworks was a significant step for me, as my previous framework experience was primarily with JavaFX, which is more of a library than a framework. Diving into ASP.NET presented a new set of challenges. Fortunately, the MVC architecture was a familiar concept, which helped me navigate through the learning process. Despite some initial difficulties, I dedicated myself to understandin the framework, and over time, I became proficient in its application.

## Conclusion üèÅ
Looking back, I'm proud of what we achieved with 'Project Bumbo'. The project was a rigorous exercise in problem-solving and innovation. We developed a solution that, in theory, could significantly improve the scheduling process for a supermarket like 'Bumbo'. By simulating various staffing scenarios, our system demonstrated potential savings in time and a reduction in unnecessary overtime. The project was a valuable learning experience, providing insights into teamwork and the practical application of theoretical knowledge.
