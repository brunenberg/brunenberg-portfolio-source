## Overview üó∫Ô∏è
'Temple of Doom' is a console application developed for a school assignment. The goal of making this application was to achieve a good understanding of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). I had to recreate the board game 'Reversi'. The player(s) have to answer a few questions about the game configuration before starting. After that, it's just a normal game of [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi).

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- Java
- Eclipse
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

## Challenges and Solutions üßóüèª
Initially it was a little difficult to get a grasp on the concept of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). I understood everything that would normally be an object, should be represented by a class. But then I also needed objects like 'Game' (one round of a match) which was confusing to me, because that is not a physical object. However, while working on my solution, I improved my understanding rapidly and I was very proud of my final product.  
  
Another difficult part about this assignment, was that I had to come up with some pretty complicated algorithms (considering my level of programming knowledge at the time). Mostly for validating the input and placing the 'disks' on the board at the right places in different directions.

The final important challenge I want to mention, is using the debugger. When I first used it, there were a lot of things on the screen and I was not sure what to make of all of it. I watched some video's about it to understand it better and soon, I understood how it worked pretty well.

## Conclusion üèÅ
This assignment laid the foundation for my OOP (Object Oriented Programming) knowledge. That is probably the single most valuable programming technology I know, and I have since gotten a lot more confortable with it. This assignment really showed me how amazing code can be. I also learned about the importance of the debugger and how to use it for finding problems in my code.
