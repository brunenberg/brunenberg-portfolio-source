      <description>Overview 🗺️ &amp;lsquo;Beestje Op Je Feestje&amp;rsquo; is an app we created in pairs using ASP.NET for a school project. The project mainly focused on validation rules, user authorization and authentication, unit testing, and hosting. An admin user can create animals with specific characteristics. These animals can then be rented by customers for a day, usually for parties. There are rules for choosing animals (for instance, some animals can&amp;rsquo;t be rented with certain others, based on their name or type).</description>

      <description>Overview 🗺️ &amp;lsquo;Project Bumbo&amp;rsquo; is a project I worked on for school, in a team of five. In a nutshell, the goal was to make a solution to a problem &amp;ldquo;Bumbo&amp;rdquo; (a supermarket chain) was struggling with. This problem was that the manager had to spend a lot of time making a schedule for every week, and the schedule&amp;rsquo;s that were produced were not efficient, because a lot of people had to work overtime and a lot of the time, too many people were working at once.</description>

      <description>Overview 🗺️ When school ended for the year and I had some spare time, I chose to start building a drawing/editing app using JavaFX. I had just learned about this technology and was curious to see how far I could get with this somewhat outdated technology. After setting up the basic features and tools like the pencil, brush, paint bucket, and eraser, I stopped working on the project. I decided it would be better to start exploring other technologies.</description>

      <description>Overview 🗺️ &amp;lsquo;Temple of Doom&amp;rsquo; is a console application developed for a school assignment. The goal of making this application was to achieve a good understanding of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). I had to recreate the board game &amp;lsquo;Reversi&amp;rsquo;. The player(s) have to answer a few questions about the game configuration before starting. After that, it&amp;rsquo;s just a normal game of Reversi.&#xA;Technologies Used 🛠️ Java Eclipse OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Challenges and Solutions 🧗🏻 Initially it was a little difficult to get a grasp on the concept of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).</description>
