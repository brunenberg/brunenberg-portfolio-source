      <description>Overview 🗺️ When school ended for the year and I had some spare time, I chose to start building a drawing/editing app using JavaFX. I had just learned about this technology and was curious to see how far I could get with this somewhat outdated technology. After setting up the basic features and tools like the pencil, brush, paint bucket, and eraser, I stopped working on the project. I decided it would be better to start exploring other technologies.</description>

      <description>Overview 🗺️ &amp;lsquo;Temple of Doom&amp;rsquo; is a console application developed for a school assignment.

The player(s) have to answer a few questions about the game configuration before starting. After that, it&amp;rsquo;s just a normal game of Reversi.&#xA;Technologies Used 🛠️ Java Eclipse OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Challenges and Solutions 🧗🏻 Initially it was a little difficult to get a grasp on the concept of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).</description>
