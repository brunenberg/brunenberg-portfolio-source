      <description>Overview 🗺️ When school ended for the year and I had some spare time, I chose to start building a drawing/editing app using JavaFX. I had just learned about this technology and was curious to see how far I could get with this somewhat outdated technology.

I decided it would be better to start exploring other technologies.</description>

      <description>Overview 🗺️ &amp;lsquo;Pane Switcher&amp;rsquo; is an application I crafted for a programming test at school. The challenge was to replicate a given example app within 90 minutes. This app featured a button that, when pressed, would modify the appearance of various panels. Although I completed the task within the exam period, I chose to refine my work at home for better results.&#xA;Technologies Used 🛠️ Java JavaFX Eclipse Challenges and Solutions 🧗🏻 The primary hurdle was incorporating a StackPane, which was new to me.</description>
