      <description>Overview 🗺️ &amp;lsquo;Beestje Op Je Feestje&amp;rsquo; is an app we created in pairs using ASP.NET for a school project. The project mainly focused on validation rules, user authorization and authentication, unit testing, and hosting. An admin user can create animals with specific characteristics. These animals can then be rented by customers for a day, usually for parties. There are rules for choosing animals (for instance, some animals can&amp;rsquo;t be rented with certain others, based on their name or type).</description>

      <description>Overview 🗺️ &amp;lsquo;Project Bumbo&amp;rsquo; is a project I worked on for school, in a team of five. In a nutshell, the goal was to make a solution to a problem &amp;ldquo;Bumbo&amp;rdquo; (a supermarket chain) was struggling with. This problem was that the manager had to spend a lot of time making a schedule for every week, and the schedule&amp;rsquo;s that were produced were not efficient, because a lot of people had to work overtime and a lot of the time, too many people were working at once.</description>
